# HW: Keep working on your final websites!

## PSA Class Monday, December 4

Next Monday's class (Week13 Dec 4) is an optional class. I will be opening up the entire class time as office hours since I know many of you have had scheduling conflicts with the regularly scheduled office hour times.

Like I said, class is optional. I will not be taking attendance. You may come and use the time to work and ask a question as they arise, or come in with a question you know you have ahead of time.
