# Week 12 notes

This week we will wrap up with a new more Bootstrap component demos before jumping into [Green Sock Animation Platform](https://gsap.com/).

Notes about GSAP:

Since I last taught this class, GSAP has changed its subscription model. Luckily we still have access to last year's release which does not require a subscription to access the core library and a few bonus libraries. That is what we will be using for our examples.

[2023 stable realease](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP)

To add the core library to your HTML project:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.12/dist/gsap.min.js"></script>
```
