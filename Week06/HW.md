# HW Due Wednesday Week07

Complete your midterm projects. You will be presenting Wednesday of Week07 not Monday. Please be sure to document your project with either a slideshow or a markdown file inside your class repo. Be sure to include:

- A demo of the site and the progress you have made
- A snippet of code you figured out (perhaps a tutorial you found or some responsive behavior you figured out)
- Next steps (if you had more time, or if you plan on continuing to add functionality for your final)

Be sure to include at least one media query in your CSS for responsive behavior. This could be for mobile or tablet. I will be asking you to resize you screen when you demo!

Since we cannot cover ever possible example needed before your midterm is due here are a few links to some W3Schools tutorials you might find helpful. If you use these tutorials in your project, be prepared to discuss how the code works, especially if it incorporates some javascript!
