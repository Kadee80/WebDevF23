### HOMEWORK:

[Read Through This Git Tutorial](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

- Add your github repo link to the [class roster google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B4P6BeTV0HJLVQjQh48D56WeWBLDA0HmdzZ0OGqRCeA/edit?usp=sharing)

- Make sure you have all software set up for next class. We won’t be using Photoshop for a few weeks but please inquire about the student discounts.

- Make a new folder in your HW repo called Week_1. Create a Markdown file containing a recipe card (CSS styling is optional). The recipe card should contain:
  - A photo of the completed dish (or placeholder img)
  - Brief description of the recipe
  - List of ingredients
  - List of instructions

Take a look at this [MarkDown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Use it to format your recipe with different text sizes and styles as well as bulleted and numbered lists. _Think Hierarchy_

- Use `git add` `git commit` and `git push` to upload these folders and files to Github, just like we did in class today.
